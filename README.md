# bellevue_site_suggestion
A semi-working template that suggests a change to the City Of Bellevue's Emergency Department site update should look like.

This site is serving as a suggestion to a rather outdated site the current City of Bellevue's Emergency Department has. Concepts from Modern Human-Computer interaction principles such as color choice, font size, and position of elements for clarity and concise-ness had been implemented on the site itself. 

# the project
The Office of Emergency Management for the City of Bellevue, WA needed an update, according to the Emergency Management Manager, Curry Mayer. Because of the nature of government websites and their use of paid vendors, we were tasked of coding a suggestion as to how the site should look after their much-needed update.

A few email exchanges later, our requirements were to be clear and concise, the reduction of pages for ease of navigation, and to improve the clarity on information distributed to the general public through their sites. More requirements include the ease of access to sign up for alerts, and to communicate to the visitors that the web pages they are visiting represent the Emergency Management Department of the City of Bellevue. Their target audience had their fair share of complaints too, from not being able to access resources that helped them sign up for alerts, to not being able to navigate the site very easily. Along with the requirements set by their office and target audience, we set out to analyze the current site and its layout of content. We found various faults such as contradictory colors, content containers that were either too large or too small for their general use, and redundancy of content that littered the page. These were added to our list of requirements in improving the siteâ€™s content and their layouts. Due to the nature of the sites and how they are implemented, we are solely going to design a semi-functional prototype website that allows it to be conveyed as a suggestion for their new site.

# bugs
The following bugs/lack of implementation are as follows:

  1. There is no home button to direct the user to the main web page (em-index.html)
  2. When the screen/browser window is small enough, the right sidebar moves under the element on the left of it
  3. Minor color inconsistencies throughout the body of the site
